# Digital Signature SDK

HTTP message signatures provide a mechanism for end-to-end authenticity and integrity for components of an HTTP message.

This PHP SDK is designed to simplify the process of generating digital signature headers and also provides a method to validate the digital signature headers.

## Digital Signatures for Public API Calls

Due to regulatory requirements emanating from SCA for our European/UK sellers, we are requiring our developers to add a digital signature for every HTTP call that is made on behalf of a EU/UK seller to certain APIs.

This SDK is generic and the signature scheme is compliant with these IETF standards:

* [RFC 9421 HTTP Message Signatures](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9421.html)
* [RFC 9530 Digest Fields](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9530.html)

## Features

This SDK is intended to generate required message signature headers, as per the above IETF standards. There is also an example included with the SDK.

This SDK incorporates

* Generation of the following HTTP message signature headers:
  * **Content-Digest**: This header includes a SHA-256 digest over the HTTP payload (as specified in [RFC 9530 Digest Fields](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9530.html)), if any. It is not required to be sent for APIs that do not include a request payload (e.g. GET requests).
  * **Signature-Input**: This header indicates which headers and pseudo-headers are included, as well as the order in which they are used when calculating the signature. It is created as specified in [RFC 9421 HTTP Message Signatures](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9421.html)
  * **Signature**: The value of the Signature header is created as described in [Section 3.1, Creating a Signature](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9421.html#name-creating-a-signature), of RFC 9421. It uses the Private Key value generated by the [Key Management API](https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/developer/key-management/overview.html).
  * **x-ebay-signature-key**: This header includes the JWE that is created using the [Key Management API](https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/developer/key-management/overview.html)
* `generateSignatureHeaders` method to generate all required headers

## Usage

**Prerequisites**

```
PHP: 7.4 or higher
```

### Install

In order to use this SDK, add it to your PHP application via composer:

```shell
composer require ebay/digital-signature-php-sdk
composer update
```

In your code, add this line to return all headers including signature headers:

```
$headers = $signature->generateSignatureHeaders($yourHeaders, $apiUrl, $method, $body);
```

Please also check the [example](#Running-the-example)

### Configure

In order to run the example application the [example-config.json](./examples/example-config.json) needs to be updated.

```json
{
  "digestAlgorithm": "<Algorithm used for generating content digest>",
  "jwe": "<JWE generated using Key Management API>",
  "privateKey": "<Path to private key generated using Key Management API>",
  "privateKeyStr": "<(alternative to privateKey) Private key generated using Key Management API, including -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- and -----END PRIVATE KEY----- key headers>",
  "signatureParams": "<List of signature params>"
}
```

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| :------ | :------ |:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `digestAlgorithm` | string | The algorithm for generating the Content-Digest header. Supported vales are `sha-256` and `sha-512`                                                                                                                                           |
| `jwe` | string | The JWE generated using the [Key Management API](https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/developer/key-management/overview.html)                                                                                                                  |
| `privateKey` | string | The privateKey generated using the [Key Management API](https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/developer/key-management/overview.html)                                                                                                           |
| `privateKeyStr` | string | (alternative to privateKey) Private key generated using [Key Management API](https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/developer/key-management/overview.html), surrounded by -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- and -----END PRIVATE KEY----- key headers |
| `signatureParams` | Array | The list of headers that indicates which headers and pseudo-headers are included, as well as the order in which they are used when calculating the signature                                                                                  |

Note: You can refer to [example-GET.php](examples/example-GET.php) or [example-POST.php](examples/example-POST.php) for examples of how to use the SDK (for a GET call without request body and for a POST call with body, respectively).

### Running the example


```shell
cd examples
composer update
php example-GET.php # or php example-POST.php
```
